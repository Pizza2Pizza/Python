# Python
These are programms implementing algorithms from Prim and Kruskal.
They are used to find a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree.

Algorithm of Kruskal is implemented based on the way it was described in the book of Volker Turau, Christoph Weyer
"Algorithmische Graphentheorie", Chapter 10.

To use these programms you have to give the path to the document with the saved graph (in this example it's "example.col")
